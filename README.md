# Segmentation Fault in C
This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in C: a segmentation fault caused by division by zero.
The `bug.c` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.c` provides a corrected version.
The error occurs because the program attempts to divide an integer by zero, which is undefined behavior in C and leads to a segmentation fault. The solution involves adding a check to prevent division by zero.
